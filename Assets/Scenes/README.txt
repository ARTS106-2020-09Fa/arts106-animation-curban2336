My animated scene is a recreation of a specific scene from JoJo's Bizarre Adventure. Specifically, the scene from Part 4 where Jotaro is fighting a small indestructible bomb tank called Sheer Heart Attack. He cannot use his stand(essentially a ghost that punches things) to destroy it. So, he creates a fire to draw the tank away from him so it doesn't blow up in his face. At the end I added a classic JoJo's "To Be Continued" arrow.

I attempted to show two emotions, anger(by having Jotaro shake and turn red) and happiness(by having Jotaro jump and rotate to show happiness in his sucess)

I attempted to use three principles:
Stretch and Squash(when characters jump and when the tank gets punched to show an effect)
Secondary Action(by having Jotaro's stand, Star Platinum(the diamond), shake back and forth and light the fire. I also attmempted to do this with the tank exploding at the end)
Follow Through and Overlapping Action(when characters move quickly or suddenly the lean in the opposite direction they are moving in to show speed and motion)
